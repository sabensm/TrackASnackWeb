If you want to eat healthier but just can't seem to lose the weight, the problem might not be the meals you eat, but the "hidden" calories you eat or drink throughout the day. 

It's very easy to sneak a cookie in the afternoon, or a candy in the morning and not add it to your calorie counting app or food journal. While these may seem small, the small things do add up. 

With Track-A-Snack there's now no reason not to track even the smallest of snacks (yup... even if you eat just one small little chocolate candy).
